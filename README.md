# Goal : Used Car price - ML Model
Goal of this project is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of this analysis, the project tries to provide clear recommendations to client as to what consumers value in a used car.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Used Cars Dataset from Kaggle. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. 

## Analysis

## Results
The best model used for this project was a linear regressor with a degree 2 polynomial complexity with a ridge cross validator. Using permutation importance, the following vehicle features were identified as important for predicting the target variable (price):
<ul>
    <li>Odomoeter reading</li>
    <li>Year</li>
    <li>4WD</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
